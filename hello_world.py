print("Hello World!")

# a = 1
# b = 2
# c = 3.5
# hi = "Hello World"


# Strong typed language e.g Java
# int a = 1;
# int b = 2;
# float c = 3.5;
# String string1 = "Hello World";

# print(1+2)
# print(a)
#
# a = 4
# print(a)

# Type Method

# tells you the data type
# print(type(hi))
# print(type(a))

# User Input

# print("Hi what is your name?")
# name = input()
# print("hi")
# print(name)


# Make a user input program that asks for:
#
#     Firstname
#     Surname
#     Age
#     DOB
#     Address
#     Postcode
#
#     Extra Task:
#     Output the data back to the user

# print("Input your details please: ")
# print("Firstname: ")
# first_name = input()
# print("Surname: ")
# surname = input()
# print("Age: ")
# age = input()
# print("DOB?: ")
# DOB = input()
# print("Address: ")
# address = input()
